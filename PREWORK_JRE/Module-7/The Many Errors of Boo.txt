- The first error I discovered was that the main head was not properly
sized.

- The second issue I noticed was the JS functions were not working.
Not only was the script not targetting the correct file, but some of the
"click" functions had no "" (for the colors and height/width). 

- I don't know if this was an issue, but the "var" was not at the top
of the page, but maybe for 'good' practice I placed it at the top.
(also a lack of documenting, which I added to make it easier in
future prospects.)

- I then recognized fault in the image tag, which had no brackets.

- Boo's list of favorite things was in shambles, having no list tags.

- Another issue of concern was the link to Boo's Wikipedia page, which
was not placed properly into the "src".

- Many of the divs were hard to read, so they were promptly spaced
accordingly.

- The random facts for Boo were not individually quoted, and therefor
all appeared in one mass of text.

			I think that sums it up.
